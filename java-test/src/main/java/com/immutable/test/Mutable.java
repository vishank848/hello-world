 * @author vishgupta
 * 
 *         Notice that in my Mutable subclass, I've overridden the behavior of
 *         getValue to read a new, mutable field declared in my subclass.
 * 
 *         As a result, your class, which initially looks immutable, really
 *         isn't immutable.
 * 
 *         I can pass this Mutable object wherever an Immutable object is
 *         expected, which could do Very Bad Things to code assuming the object
 *         is truly immutable.
 * 
 *         Marking the base class final prevents this from happening.
